Then in 2016, the state fully legalized marijuana for recreational use, not only making possession of small amounts legal, but also creating a regulatory system for producing marijuana for sale. \n",

According to this theory, with drug legalization, we should see violent crime decrease after legalization in places where drug arrests had previously been common. \n",

BUT: pre-post comparisons are imperfect. If we knew that violent crime was not going to change at all in a world without drug legalization, then this comparison is perfectly valid.

You have a patient with a headache, you give them tylenol, and then the next day you ask them if they still have a headache, and find out that they don't — does that mean that tylenol cured the headache? Maybe... but most headaches eventually resolve on their own, so maybe the headache would have passed with or without the patient taking tylenol!
