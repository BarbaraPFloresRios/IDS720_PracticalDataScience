Then in 2016, the state fully legalized marijuana for recreational use, not only making possession of small amounts legal, but also creating a regulatory system for producing marijuana for sale. \n",

According to this theory, with drug legalization, we should see violent crime decrease after legalization in places where drug arrests had previously been common. \n",

BUT: pre-post comparisons are imperfect. If we knew that violent crime was not going to change at all in a world without drug legalization, then this comparison is perfectly valid.

Maybe... but most headaches eventually resolve on their own, so maybe the headache would have passed with or without the patient taking tylenol!
