However, this data should suffice for helping to understand wealth inequality in the United States. \n",

So you can't just use `min()` or `max()`. We'll discuss converting string variables into numbers in a future class."

    "Now let's estimate the racial income gap in the United States. What is the average salary for employed Black Americans, and what is the average salary for employed White Americans? In percentage terms, how much more does the average White American make than the average Black American?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** these values are not quite accurate estimates. As we'll discuss in later lessons, to get completely accurate estimates from the ACS we have to take into account how people were selected to be interviewed. But you get pretty good estimates in most cases even without weights—your estimate of the racial wage gap without weights is within 5\\% of the corrected value. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This is actually an underestimate of the wage gap. The US Census treats Hispanic respondents as a sub-category of \"White.\" While all ethnic distinctions are socially constructed, and so on some level these distinctions are all deeply problematic, this coding is inconsistent with what most Americans think of when they hear the term \"White,\" a term *most* Americans think of as a category that is mutually exclusive of being Hispanic or Latino (categories which are also usually conflated in American popular discussion). With that in mind, most researchers working with US Census data split \"White\" into \"White, Hispanic\" and \"White, Non-Hispanic\" using `race` *and* `hispan`. But for the moment, just identify \"White\" respondents using the value in `race`.\n",

    "Store your results in `results` under the keys `\"ex8_avg_income_black\"`, `\"ex8_avg_income_white\"`, and the percentage difference as `ex8_racial_difference`. Please note the wording above when calculating the percentage difference to ensure you get the reference category correct, and interpret your result as well."
