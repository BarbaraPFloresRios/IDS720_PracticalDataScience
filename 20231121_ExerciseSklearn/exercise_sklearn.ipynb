    "## Machine Learning in Medicine\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, we'll learn to fit and evaluate (in a basic way) machine learning models using the package `scikit-learn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emphasis of these exercises is to help you get comfortable with the data-wrangling component of machine learning so that in future courses you can focus on the *theory* underlying machine learning. With that in mind, we will be quite cavalier with model fitting and evaluation. As with our `statsmodels` exercises—in which we quickly ran through a few models to practice model *implemention* without thinking too much about model selection and specification—this is **not** how you should do your actual data science analyses!\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this is true generally, it is doubly true in the context of these exercises: the application of machine learning to medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, we will use the birth-weight data we used for our `statsmodels` exercises to predict birth weights. As you will see, implementing a machine learning model to predict birth weights is actually surprisingly straightforward. But that ease is deceptive; while machine learning algorithms are easy to use, they're hard to use *well*, and if you get them wrong in contexts where they impact real people, poorly implemented machine learning models can literally kill people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lest you think I'm being hyperbolic, consider the case of a machine learning model used by medical providers across the US to make treatment decisions for millions of people. The goal of the model (distributed by a company called Optum) was to help providers figure out what patients were especially likely to face health problems down the road, so they could provide these patients extra preventative care.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem, though, is that the way Optum did this was by training a supervised machine learning model to predict future healthcare use by patients. Patients the model predicted would consume more healthcare in the future, the model implicitly *assumed*, were those who should get extra care today.\n",
    "\n",
    "But [as was recently described in a paper in the journal Science](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/24/racial-bias-medical-algorithm-favors-white-patients-over-sicker-black-patients/), the problem is that the model had a large racial bias, and was less likely to recommend extra preventative care for black patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason was that Black patients in the United States tend to use the medical system less than White patients *even when the Black patients have the same level of medical need as White patients*. Why? The paper doesn't explore that fully, but the causes likely include skepticism towards the medical establishment due to the history of Black Americans being used as [unknowing test subjects for medical studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment), or the fact that Black Americans tend to have lower incomes and are less likely to be insured than White Americans.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when this model saw that Black patients didn't consume as much healthcare in the future, the algorithm interpreted that as evidence that Black patients *didn't need* healthcare in the future. This resulted in the model falsely telling doctors that Black patients were systematically less in need of preventative care.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crucially, this occurred even though race wasn't even a variable in the model.** Machine learning models are very good at picking up subtle signals, and so even though patient race wasn't an explicit factor in the model, the model was nevertheless able to differentiate Black and White patients. Though it's not clear exactly how it did so, this can happen whenever variables are included in models that are *correlated* with race. For example, people's zip codes (which identify where people live) are notorious for proxying for race in machine learning algorithms since residential segregation in the US means that most people in a given zip code are of the same race.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so as a result, this well-meaning machine learning algorithm resulted in black patients receiving fewer preventative medical interventions than white patients, even after taking into account other (medically relevant) factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "So: in this exercise, we'll play with predicting birth weights in infants. But do **NOT** think that just because it's this easy to fit a model, it is appropriate to then go use these in the real world in contexts where people's lives are affected!"

    "1. Splitting your data into two parts (a training set and a test set), \n",
    "2. Training your model on the training set (i.e. set the parameters of your model to best explain the training data).\n",
    "3. Testing the model by using the parameters generated during that training to predict values for the testing data, then comparing the predicted values for the testing data to the actual values in the test data. The smaller the difference between the predicted values and the true values in the testing data, the better the model is said to perform.\n",

    "Suppose we just wanted to use linear regression as our model. First, we'd randomly pick 80% our data, then regress birth weight on the various variables (\"features\" in machine learning terminology) we specified above. Then we'd use the coefficients from that regression to predict birth weights for the 20% of children we didn't use in our estimation, and see how different those predictions are from actual birth weights. If we find a model that performs well on our testing data, then we *assume* (*hope*) that that model will also work well on new data (i.e. on children who haven't been born yet whose weight we want to predict).\n",
