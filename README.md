# IDS720_PracticalDataScience
This repository archives and shares my `'Practical Data Science'` class assignments at Duke University. This course offers hands-on experience with real data using essential data science tools, like command line, Git, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks, to ensure data versatility.

In this repository, you'll find tasks and assignments from `Nick Eubank`'s class. 
We completed many of them during our classes, often working together with classmates.
