# IDS720_PracticalDataScience
This repository archives and shares my 'Practical Data Science' class assignments, offering hands-on experience with real data using essential data science tools, like command line, Git, Python (especially NumPy and Pandas), and Jupyter Notebooks, to ensure data versatility.

In this repository, we have the following tasks/assignments completed during classes, many of which were done in collaboration with classmates. The authors' names are included in the corresponding Jupyter notebooks
