# IDS720_PracticalDataScience
This repository archives and shares my `'Practical Data Science'` class assignments, a course that offers hands-on experience with real data using essential data science tools, like command line, Git, Python (especially NumPy and Pandas), and Jupyter Notebooks, to ensure data versatility.

In this repository, you'll find tasks and assignments from `Nick Eubank`'s class. 
We completed many of them during our classes, often working together with classmates.
